[Music, Politics & Diplomacy].

This course examines the use of music for political purposes. More 
specifically we will focus on the relationship between music and 
politics via diplomacy, social movements, torture, nationalism, and 
protectionism. Starting with a theoretical approach to the 
understanding of music, the course will draw on historical and 
contemporary examples of when music was used for political and 
diplomatic purposes—also as a tool to understand these purposes—in 
the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. More broadly, 
this course aims to provide practical and theoretical tools to 
address the complex issues confronting the use of music for 
diplomacy, and to rethink political power beyond the nation-state. 
Methodologically, the course will introduce students to sound and 
performance analysis, among other non-textual approaches.

[Oral Hist/Document. Filmmaking].

In this class, we will learn the oral history and documentary 
interviewing skills to create podcasts, documentary films, museum 
exhibits and multimedia projects. We will discuss the ethical 
challenges and creative strategies involved in research, interviewing, 
editing and dissemination. What are the cutting-edge technologies now 
making this field more accessible and exciting? Guest presenters will 
offer real world insights from their work in journalism, documentary 
and human rights advocacy. We will view documentaries from and about 
the Arab world as well as other regions. Take this class if you are 
interested in learning an oral history approach to interviewing, or 
are planning your own documentary project, ethnographic fieldwork or 
multimedia journalism. Final project will be the student’s choice: 
paper, audio or other media.
