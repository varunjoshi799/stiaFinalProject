 In course, take look politics Africa lens fiction film.
 Our discussions focus transformative historical political moments shaped African continent course last two centuries.
 We begin reading Joseph Conrads Heart Darkness, fictional narrative written heydays European colonialism, means understand profound inescapable effects colonization.
 We also explore fictional accounts Apartheid South Africa, Mau Mau Rebellion Kenya, Biafran War Nigeria, among others, order understand close inextricable links literature politics Africa.
 The enormous impact iconic political figures Nelson Mandela Seretse Khama fiction film also considered.

 [Africa People].
 What Africa you?
 How Africa written?
 How Africa written?
 These fundamental questions among crucial questions informing direction class, worlds second largest continent, Africa—humankinds cradle—will center discussions.
 We contend historical representations Africa, peoples, societies cultures, means imagine Africa contemporary moment.
 In so, leave representation Africa geographic tragedy complex space long teemed human vibrancy enabled peopling world.

 [Intra-Africa Cooperation].
 There recent resurgence inter-state cooperation Africa security economic issues.
 These developments brought new focus regional economic communities well continent-wide organizations like African Union African Development Bank.
 This raises two important questions: (1) explains observed patterns inter-state cooperation security, trade, investment Africa?
 ; (2) conditions inter-state cooperation yielded results attempt provide African solutions African problems?
 This class examine need cooperate security economic matters driving inter-state cooperation Africa.
 The goal class systematically interrogate logic inter-state cooperation region, workings key sub-regional continental organizations.
 Terrorist organizations like al-Shabaab, AQIM, Boko Haram, well ongoing civil conflict number countries, present new challenges African states, forced seek regional approaches deal emerging security threats.
 Why African states seek international assistance face security threats others not?
 And impact regional organizations state development Africa?
 At time, Africa dozen regional economic communities, country member least two.
 Yet 12%, intra-Africa trade among lowest region word.
 If Africas borders artificial, impervious trade?
 How regional economic cooperation impacted intra-Africa trade general mobility goods, services, people?
 The class pay special attention ongoing interstate infrastructure projects NEPAD initiative; well main political economic communities African Union, ECOWAS, EAC, SADC, COMESA.

 [Economics Africa].
 This course open first year undergraduate students.
 This course concerned understanding analysis African Economies.
 We explore many issues African economies grappling today progress eliminate poverty improve livelihoods millions.
 Specifically, examine questions as, structure African economies, key sectors challenges opportunities therein?
 What Africas role global economy?
 The course structured three core parts: The first part overview understand African economies, second part covers, in-depth, seven key topics matter viability performance African economies, third part course take international perspective analyze role Africa world economy, discussing issues trade foreign aid.
 After taking course, students expected good understanding current opportunities challenges faced African economies, understand Africa stands Africa contributes world economy, able intelligent conversations wide range socio-economic topics African continent.

 Hence, distinguish waste produced humans humans produced waste, distinction show us human-produced waste, otherwise known anthropogenic waste, produced equally around globe.
 For example, 2000 2020, Africa, compared rest world, contributed 3.9 percent carbon emissions (Kamer 2022), making least polluting continent yet vulnerable paradoxically.
 These key questions consider: What intersections race, class, gender, history play production waste?
